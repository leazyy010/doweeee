            <div class="caption">I'm sorry. I know there's probably little to no chance for us to get back together, but I still wanted to make this. I'm sorry for saying a lot of hurtful things and for not being able to control my emotions. While that's not an excuse, I hope you know that you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I wasn't able to express what I really wanted to say before because I didn’t even know what kind of answers I was looking for. So I made this simple website to let you know for the last time.</div>

            <div class="caption">Doty, you are one of the kindest people I've met and also undeniably the prettiest, despite how much you try to deny or cringe. Honestly, you are the best gaming buddy. I know we fought a lot while playing, but that doesn't change the fact that I was really happy playing with you. There's nothing more I could've ever asked for. I know I said that there are things that I also didn't like about you or our relationship. But that didn't really make you less perfect. We still had a lot to fix, well, more on me, and I'm sorry for making you wait for too long.</div>

            <div class="caption">I'm really sorry about the things that I said. I wanted to be understood and asked you why you think so little of what I did for our relationship. It was stupid of me when I didn't even tell you a single thing about how hard it was for me back then, so how would you really understand? I even told you not to let me guess when it comes to this kind of thing, and that's exactly what I did. It affected me to the point that I wasn't even listening to you when it came to things.</div>
